## a. What is an Issue?

Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. As issues are created, theyâ€™ll appear in a searchable and filterable list.

## b. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed changes before integrating them into the main codebase.

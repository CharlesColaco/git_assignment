## a. What is an Issue?

Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. As issues are created, theyâ€™ll appear in a searchable and filterable list.

## b. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed changes before integrating them into the main codebase.

3. Above the list of files, in the banner, click **Compare & pull request** to create a pull request for the associated branch.
4. Use the **base branch** dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the **compare branch** dropdown menu to choose the topic branch where you made your changes.
5. Type a **title** and **description** for your pull request.
6. To create a pull request that is ready for review, click **Create Pull Request**.
